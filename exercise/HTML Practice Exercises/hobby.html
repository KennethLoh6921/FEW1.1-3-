        <p><strong><em>Badminton</em> is an hardest sport and also most expensive sport</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Badminton is a <em>racquet sport played with a shuttlecock and rackets.</em> It can be played by two (singles) or four (doubles) players on a rectangular court divided by a net. The objective is to score points by hitting the shuttlecock over the net and landing it within the opponent's half of the court, while preventing them from doing the same.</strong></p>
